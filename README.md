# Mobile-OTT

This is a sample iOS application that functions as an Over-the-Top (OTT) streaming service. Users can sign up using their Google account via Firebase authentication. Once logged in, users can browse a list of videos and view details for each video, including related content. Videos can be played within the app, with playback features including play/pause, seek bar, and full screen mode. The app also implements “continue watching” functionality, which allows users to resume playback from where they left off.

Here are the key technical details of the application:

Sign Up/Login: Uses Firebase Google Authentication
Content Listing: Fetches data from a JSON URL
Video Playback: Plays videos with standard playback controls (play/pause, seek bar) and full screen mode.
Continue Watching: Stores user progress using Core Data or Firebase
This project demonstrates proficiency in the following areas:

iOS development
Firebase integration
Video playback
JSON data parsing
User authentication
Note: This is a sample application and does not include features like user accounts, subscriptions, or content security.
